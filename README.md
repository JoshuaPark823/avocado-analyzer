# Avocado Analyzer ðŸ¥‘
## Data Science Visualization & Exploratory Analysis

### Description ðŸ¥‘
- Recently I found an interesting dataset whilst looking around on Kaggle. The dataset contains information such as:</br>
  - Date - The date of the observation
  - AveragePrice - the average price of a single avocado
  - type - conventional or organic
  - year - the year
  - Region - the city or region of the observation
  - Total Volume - Total number of avocados sold

- So ofcourse, appealing to my sporadic, millenial interests, I've decided to do some **exploratory data analysis** with the hopes of finding any interesting trends.

### Project Goal (1-2 Month Projection) ðŸ¥‘
- Build a classification model that accurately classifies the region of an avocado solely based on parameters. 
- Build a **Predictive Deep Learning** model that accurately predicts the price of avocados in the next N days, which region will have the cheapest avocado prices, which day will have the lowest price next month, etc

### Languages & Technologies/Libraries/APIs ðŸ¥‘
- Python 3.8.3
- NumPy and Pandas API
- MatPlotLib API for Data Visualization
- Dash API and Plot.ly (Dashboard)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Django Web Framework (Tentative, May decide to convert the project into a responsive web application)
- ScikitLearn / Tensorflow + Keras (Tentative, End Goal)

### Major Hurdles & Solutions (Always gotta find the solution!) ðŸ¥‘
- Issue: Currently the first major hurdle is that I do **not** have access to any text editors or downloadable applications at all. I only have access to a web browser. 
- Solution: Use the free Jupyter Notebook server on their public website hosted with mybinder and keep track of the project through GitHub using the web UI. Very bad practice and poor workflow, but currently it's all I have access to.
